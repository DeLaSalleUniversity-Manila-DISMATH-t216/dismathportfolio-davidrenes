DISMATH-EL Portfolio
<h1>RENES, David Randall T. - My Weekly Portfolio - DISMATH Section EL</h1>
<h1><b>WEEK 1:</b></h1>
<p><b>We were introduced to a new course called Discrete Mathematics, DISMATH for short.</b></p>
<h3><b>What is Proof?</b></h3>
<p>A mathematical proof of a PROPOSITION is a chain of logical deductions leading to the PROPOSITION from a base set of axioms</p>
<h3><b>Terms in DISMATH:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Proposition</li>
<li>Proof</li>

<h1><b>WEEK 2:</b></h1>
<p><b>We were introduced to different kinds of logic like Propositional Logic and Predicate Logic.</b></p>
<h3><b>Propositional Logic</b></h3>
<p>Propositional Logic deals with propositions as a whole</p>
<h3><b>Predicate Logic</b></h3>
<p>Predicate Logic is concerned not only with logic relations between sentences or propositions as "wholes", but also their internal stucture in terms of SUBJECT and PREDICATE.</p>
<h3><b>Quantifiers</b></h3>
<p>It indicates the generality of the open sentence in which a variable occurs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Quantifiers</li>
<p>&nbsp&nbspMany Mathematical statements assert that a property is true for all values of a variable in a particular domain.</p>
<li>Existential Quantifier</li>
<p>&nbsp&nbspIt is true if and only if P(x) is true for at least one value of x in the domain</p></ul>
<h3><b>Rules of Inference</b></h3>
<h3>Terms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Argument</li>
<li>Valid</li>
<li>Fallacy</li></ul>
<h3><b>Rules of Inference Tautologies</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Modus Ponens</li>
<li>Modus Tollens</li>
<li>Hypothetical Syllogism</li>
<li>Disjunctive Syllogism</li>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Simplification</li>
<li>Conjunction</li>
<li>Resolution</li></ul>
<h1><b>WEEK 3:</b></h1>
<p><b>We were introduced to different methods of PROOF.</b></p>
<h3><b>Methods of Proof</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Direct Proof</li>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp(1)Assume p is true.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp(2)Show that q is also true.</p>
<li>Proof by Contraposition</li>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe take ¬q as a hypothesis, and using definitions, and previously proven theorems, we show that ¬p must follow.<p>
<li>Vacuous Proof</li>
<p>&nbsp&nbspShow that p is false. Because, p⇒q must be true when p is false.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp¬p⇒(p⇒q)</p>
<li>Trivial Proof</li>
<p>&nbsp&nbspShow that q is true. It follows that p⇒q must be also true.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspq⇒(p⇒q)</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 4:</b></h1>
<p><b>We were introduced to Mathematical Induction</b></p>
<h3><b>Mathematical Induction</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp(1)Basis Step: p(1) is shown to be true.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp(2)Inductive Step. (Show)</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 5:</b></h1>
<p><b>We were introduced to Recursive Algorithms, Program Correctness, Hoare Triple, Power Series, and Set Theory.</b><p>
<h3><b>Recursive Algorithm</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspSolves a problem by reducing it to a smaller yet identical problem</p>
<h3><b>Program Correctness</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspProblems involving program correctness are solved using 2 ways mainly showing that the program terminates and by partial correctness</p>
<h3>Hoare Triple</h3>
<p>p{s}q, where s is the program segment</p>
<h3>Power Series</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe were mainly taught what power series is and how to represent different functions as a power series</p>
<h3>Set Theory</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe were introduced to Sets and Set Builder Notations</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 6:</b></h1>
<p>We were introduced to functions</p>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe learned also about domain, codomain, and range.</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 7:</b></h1>
<h3>No Classes</h3>
<h1><b>WEEK 8:</b></h1>
<p>This week we were mainly introduced to algorithms</p>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe were also introduced to Pseudocodes wherein it is a sort of a simpler programming language.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe were also taught how to search for algorithms.</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 9:</b></h1>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe were introduced to different sorts of algorithms</p>
<p><b>Bubble Sort</b></p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspSorts elements in order by adjacent elements.</p>
<p><b>Insertion Sort</b></p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspSorts elements in a more simple way.</p>
<p><b>Greedy Algorithm</b></p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspMaximizes or minimizes parameters and is used ing optimization problems.</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 10:</b></h1>
<p>We learned about growth of functions, algorithm time complexity, division and modulo operator, and cryptography.</p>
<p><b>Cryptography</b></p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe learned about the meathod Julius Caesar invented, Caesar Cipher</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 11:</b></h1>
<p>No classes</p>
<h1><b>WEEK 12:</b></h1>
<p>We learned about graph theory, euler circuit, hamilton circuit, matrices, isomorphism, and kurotowski's theorem.</p>
<h3>Graph Theory</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe were introduced to the graph and it's parts mainly the vertices, degrees, and the edges.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe were also introduced to the handshake theorem which is a formula to obtain a value for the number of edges provided that the value of the vertices and degrees are given.</p>
<h3>Euler Circuit/Path</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspA Euler circuit represents a graph that pases through all edges without repition and returns to the starting point.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspA Euler path represents a graph that passes through all edges without repition and does not return to the starting point. It has exactly 2 vertices which have odd degrees.</p>
<h3>Hamilton Circuit/Path</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspA Hamilton circuit passes through all vertices without repition and returns to the starting point.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspA Hamilton path passes through all vertices without repition and does not return to the starting point.</p>
<h3>Isomorphism</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspIn the long run, it is basically a remodelled version of a certain graph wherein each vertex and degree are connected to the same vertex or degree they were connected to from the start</p>
<h3>Planar and Non-Planar graphs</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspPlanar graphs are graphs wherein no edge is allowed to intersect with another, this can be achived by finding a seemingly non-planar graphs's isomorphic equivalent which is planar in nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspKurotowski's Theorem is basically that K(3,3), K(5) and graphs beyon those are non-planar graphs.</p>
<h3><b>WEEK 13:</b></h3>
<p>We learned about trees, graph coloring, and automata theoy.<p>
<h3>Graph Coloring</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspThis is basically assigning a certain color to a vertex and vertices that are adjacent to this vertex have to have different colors from that certain vertex</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspThe Chromatic number is the number of colors used in graph coloring</p>
<h3>Trees</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspThis is basically a graph where the root vertex is specified and it has children vertices below it</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbspThe order wherein the children of a certain parent are positioned in such a way that the greater ones are at the right and the lesser ones are on the left</p>
<h3>Automata Theory</h3>
<p>&nbsp&nbspWe learned that the automata theory is a study on the laws of computation and we were also introduced to the finite-state machine.</p>
